ARCOS have been working with the national community with the aim of establishing a national Kubernetes service.\nSo straight off the bat I have thrown a product in your face. I could spend the next several paragraphs going over what Kubernetes (k8s) is but a simple search on the Internet would provide you with more material on this that you could or would want to handle. Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s just say that this product falls within the Cloud category, is IT candy and all so good you will come back for more.\nThe CeRDS team have been active members of the ARCOS working groups for some time and have acknowledged the benefits that participation within this community can bring. It is no secret that the concepts of \u0026amp;ldquo;Cloud Native\u0026amp;rdquo; and \u0026amp;ldquo;Hybrid Cloud\u0026amp;rdquo; are permeating in to all areas of information technology including supporting services for research. What is usually missing is a plain explanation as to why\u0026amp;hellip; So here is my attempt.\n The most powerful advantage IMHO is that the \u0026amp;ldquo;Cloud\u0026amp;rdquo;, while conjuring up images of white fluffy unicorns, can with some wizardry, not only incorporate large scale Corporate base infrastructure but also (and wait for it) incorporate an edge service like a data collector (think IoT), server (what we in the IT industry lovingly call bare metal) dedicated to things like data pre-processing as well as your very own laptop. This essentially means that complex services running at multiple locations can be managed with better security and less overheads paving the way for systems that run where it makes sense. Trust me, this is very powerful and cool. It provides an environment where many traditional as well as new services and processes can thrive. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m not going to hand you the cool aid. Cloud services do not make a complex workflow easy but it does help to make them manageable. I foresee your sceptical gaze and do not blame you.
