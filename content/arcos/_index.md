# Why at UWA?

[ARCOS](https://arcos.ardc.edu.au) have been working with the national community with the aim of establishing a national Kubernetes service.

The CeRDS team have been active members of the ARCOS working groups for some time and have acknowledged the benefits that participation within this community can bring.
It is no secret that the concepts of "Cloud Native" and "Hybrid Cloud" are permeating in to all areas of information technology including supporting services for research.
What is usually missing is a plain explanation as to why... So here is my attempt.

1. The most powerful advantage IMHO is that the "Cloud", while conjuring up images of white fluffy unicorns, can with some wizardry, not only
   incorporate large scale Corporate base infrastructure but also (and wait for it) incorporate an edge service like a data collector (think IoT), server
   (what we in the IT industry lovingly call spinning rust) dedicated to things like data pre-processing as well as your very own laptop. This essentially means
   that complex services running at multiple locations can be managed with better security and less overheads paving the way for systems that run where it makes sense.
   Trust me, this is very cool and provides an environment where new services and processes can thrive.
2. Many practices come along with this type of change. I'm going to rattle of some terms you may have heard, so here goes, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD),
   DevSecOps (shortened from the words Development, Security, Operations), Infrastructure as Code (IoC). There are many more but you get the point. All of these terms mean
   pretty much the same thing, faster, safer, cheaper, more consistent outcomes starting from the formation of an idea all the way to the end product including support. Sound
   like something you need?
3. Lots more to come but I need to get on with other stuff... Will get back to this shortly.

This community has been investigating the benefits of Cloud Native and Hybrid Cloud service to better support research for some time 
and have come up with a number of services that the CeRDS team consider essential to the long term support of research activities.
