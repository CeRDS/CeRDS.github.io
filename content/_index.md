# Characterisation eResearch & Data Science (CeRDS)

As part of the [Center for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis](https://www.cmca.uwa.edu.au/) (CMCA) within [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/) (UWA), we enable research excellence by providing world-class microscopy and microanalysis facilities and expertise to publicly funded researchers and industry.

CeRDS is the platform specialist group for the CMCA and facilitates the:
* inclusion of automated process and workflows into research work practices
* implements fit-for-purpose services and infrastructure

CMCA includes nodes for a number of national groups such as Microscopy Australia (MA) and National Imaging Facility (NIF).

CeRDS has been a contributing member of a number of National projects:
* The Australian Characterisation Commons at Scale (ACCS)
  * TruDat (MyTARDIS) data store
    * FAIR data repository
    * Primarily but not limited to the management and processing upload retention of Microscopy Australia related imaging analysis workflows.
  * Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)
    * Access to National HPC resource with Federated and consistent desktop experience
    * HPC as a Service (HPCaaS)
    * Software stack for research workflows and analysis
    * Software and workflow containers, Singularity and Docker
    * VDI style interface
* Australian Imaging Service (AIS)
  * AIS XNAT data repository
    * FAIR data repository
    * Primarily but not limited to the management and processing of Medical imaging
    * Inclusion of Machine Learning (NVIDIA CLARA) for imaging analysis
* Australian Research Container Orchestration Services (ARCOS)
  * Integration of cloud native services into research workflows, focusing on Kubernetes within HPC infrastructure
  * Maintenance and retention of research related containers
  * Facilitating software into the FAIR principal and potentially linking software stacks to DOIs for publications
  * Currently trialling a National container repository caching service
  * Looking at long term retention of software stacks

## Ethos

Agnostic to operating system, vendors and service providers. This in no ways means that these services are not part of each deployment.
In fact this makes site specific considerations in product selection more viable and produces a more competitive market.
As collaboration and federation of national service is a core goal of many projects CeRDS is part of, focusing on a single service
provider would limit the impact of solutions and hinder adoption of service based on site preferences,
restrictions, budgets and pre-existing arrangements.

Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) that incorporates a paid support model will be preferred. This not only allows
the standard battery of security assessments that all software can be subjected to, but also source code evaluation. FOSS can
help to mitigate a number of risks such as, in the event software becomes unsupported or deprecated FOSS provides the option to
take over support or Fork the code source for specific purpose, it also provides the option of contributing to the upstream project if
functionality is required that is not currently part of the existing software. This is in addition to options provided by other more
traditional software selection processes including vendor agreements and software replacement. FOSS also ensures that each site can,
without restriction, follow project recommendations and provides pathways for quick evaluation, development and implementation
of best practice application life cycle management.

Cloud native.

Hybrid cloud.
