# Characterisation eResearch & Data Science (CeRDS)

As part of the [Center for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis](https://www.cmca.uwa.edu.au/) (CMCA) within [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/) (UWA), we enable research excellence by providing world-class microscopy and microanalysis facilities and expertise to publicly funded researchers and industry.

CeRDS is the platform specialist group for the CMCA and facilitates the:
* inclusion of automated process and workflows into research work practices
* implements fit-for-purpose services and infrastructure

CMCA includes nodes for a number of national groups such as Microscopy Australia (MA) and National Imaging Facility (NIF).

CeRDS has been a contributing member of a number of National projects:
* The Australian Characterisation Commons at Scale (ACCS)

  Notable outcomes for UWA are:
  * TruDat (MyTARDIS) data store
    * FAIR data repository
    * Primarily but not limited to the management and processing upload retention of Microscopy Australia related imaging analysis workflows.
  * Characterisation Virtual Laboratory (CVL)
    * HPC as a Service
    * Software stack for research workflows and analysis
    * Software and workflow containers, Singularity and Docker
    * VDI style interface
  * Australian Imaging Service (AIS)
    * AIS XNAT data repository
      * FAIR data repository
      * Primarily but not limited to the management and processing of Medical based imaging
  * Australian Research Container Orchestration Services (ARCOS)
    * Integration of cloud native services into research workflows, focusing on Kubernetes within HPC infrastructure
    * Maintenance and retention of research related containers
    * Facilitating software into the FAIR principal and potentially linking software stacks to DOIs for publications
    * Currently trialling a National container repository caching service
    * Looking at long term retention of software stacks
